PREFACE
=======
Thanks for installing Friday Night Robo Blast:XMAS Test.
This is not associated with SEGA/Sonic Team, Sonic Team Jr. (made the original SRB2), or with the Funkin' Crew.
Feel free to read ahead at your own pace!

REQUIREMENTS
===============
1. YoshiCrafter Engine by YoshiCrafter29 - https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/YoshiCrafterEngine
2. A computer able to run it. 
(For macOS users like me, download this: https://gamebanana.com/mods/389961, albeit, its a tiny bit outdated, it still runs the mod fine!)
3. A decent hearing ability

VERSION HISTORY
===============

v0.90 - Initial (test) release.

'PLOT'.
=======

Sonic has recieved an invitation from Eggman! He wants Sonic to travel to his Eggbase
for a Christmas reunion! However, Eggman's robots are well positioned everywhere,
to actually give Eggman time to prepare while he's cooking!

It's up to Sonic to beat the robots and drink eggnog with Eggman in his Eggbase...
that last bit sounded really freaky, didn't it?
"Hello Boy, what are you doing here?"

Well, to lighten up the load and to add some meaning to this mod, Sonic just happened to stumble across Boyfriend (from the hit game, Friday Night Funkin') and decided to sing some carols along the way to Eggman's Eggbase!
"I'll play with you some other time! I have no time to play!"

DIFFICULTY
==========

Depending on what skill level you should choose, this will show you how many
lives and continues you'll get with each skill level.

CAKEWALK        - Easiest, can't die by losing health (on YCE 2.3.2 I think, haven't tested. Few robots.
EASY            - Also Easy, few robots, chart is kind of buggy as of writing this, I need to fix the scroll speed, but it is beatable. (Update: fixed Easy and Cakewalk scroll speed.)
NORMAL          - Average difficulty, average number of robots and notes.
HARD            - Difficult, depends on how good you are at rhythm games..
VERY HARD       - The original poor chart, very difficult for newcomers. I don't recommend it unless you're a rhythmic expert. Only available in Freeplay mode as it freezes the game* in Story mode, I'll try to provide a fix when I can.
(*No, that's not a snow joke.)

BUGS
==================
Loading Very Hard (difficulty) freezes the game. This will be fixed in the next update.
If playing this on YoshiCrafter Engine 1.9, you can't die on Cakewalk mode. Not sure if this applies to future versions, probably not.

Update stuffs.
==================
- means a removed feature, probably due to it being buggy / no-one liked it.
+ means a new feature has been added to this version.
F bug fix.
X means some adjustments have been made to either the game or visuals.
O means some important info lies here.

0.9 (Release)
==================
F / Dev bug where the background messed up. Easy fix.
X / Boyfriend's spritesheet is converted to the Doom color palette.
O / First version of the mod.

FAQ
===

From the SRB2 FAQ, edited accordingly.:
(http://ssrg.emulationzone.org/stjr/updates/srb2faq.htm)

i. The game is way too bright!

...They're ice texures, what do you expect? ^_^

Seriously, just change your computer's brightness settings. Laptops also suffer badly from this - but then again,
the ORIGINAL Friday Night Funkin' was pretty poor with a laptop, use a PC instead.

ii. That freakin' parallax is annoying me!

Fixes coming soon.

iii. Hey! You changed some stuff from the early versions!

They were completely useless and temporary, such as old Sonic sprites, and really old footage containing the Week 1 stage.
2.

iv. Woah! The Air Spin Attack is very unstable!

It's not perfected yet, but it's a lot better than it was in v0.90! ;-)

v. The sprite is weird!

The sprite is more complete than the one seen in earlier screenshots I've posted on Twitter/left in the files, but it's
still not complete. Better to half of SRB2's art style than none at all.

Tails' sprites aren't in the game yet.

vi. Where are the secrets?! Why are there only one level?! Where's the gameplay?!
You and this game suck!

Note the word 'TEST' - I developed this to make quick a Christmas mod,
not a complete mod. Would you rather we added secrets to FNRB:XMAS and spent
some more time on that, meaning a longer wait for FNRB normal, or more for FNRB
normal when it comes out? This version will get some more secrets, and you can grab
add-on levels from the Mod Archives (coming soon!), but it's still NOT INTENDED
as a full mod.

vii. Why does Boyfriend look like that?

I manually converted his sprites to the Doom color palette. I forgot you could do that in SLADE but that's beside the point.

General coding inspiration, really cool person. Also she was making a Christmas mod but screw that, this one's actually released!
The credits for her inside of the engine I'm using is outdated so updated links are used here and for the mod's credits screen.
If none of these links work, let me know!
-Her YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLr5zAesggUSXlLd9J6vfjw

SSNTails and Sonikku:
Original guys. Need I say less.

Old friend of mine who hates me and is mean to me for some unspoken reason. Made the BF voices that I used in the song but forgot to change and they sounded good nonetheless.

Credit to whoever made Sonic's chromatic scale sounds very nice.
Also special thanks to whoever made the SRB2 Christmas 2.2 port for SRB2. That kind of helped in some aspect.
